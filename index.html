    <p>
        Whether it's used for top-down trips on the Sunset Strip or track time at Lime Rock, there's
        a 2022 Ford Mustang for most every lifestyle and personality. With countless
        <a href="gallery.html" target="_blank">appearance packages</a>,
        notable performance-enhancing options, and coupe or convertible body styles, it can be highly personalized.
        Power comes from a punchy turbo four or a mighty 5.0-liter V-8; both engines feed the rear wheels through an
        engaging manual transmission or a terrific 10-speed automatic. While all models are fun to drive, Ford offers
        myriad packages to up the excitement, culminating in the track-focused Mach 1. Even the most aggressive Mustang
        (excluding the 760-hp Shelby GT500) can be driven every day, and it has a roomier back seat and better
        outward visibility than the Chevy Camaro. When it comes to pony cars, there's none better than the 2022
        Mustang, which is why it's on our Editors' Choice list.
